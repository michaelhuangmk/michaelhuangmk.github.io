                <h6>Hi there!</h6>
                <p>I'm Michael, a sophomore studying Information Science at Cornell, with concentrations in User Experience, Interactive Technologies, and Behavioral Science.</p>
                <p>Although I intended to study Economics, I found a passion for product design through some great mentors and professors.</p>
                <p>In school, I am a product designer for <a href="http://cornelldti.org/">Cornell Design & Tech Initiative</a>, the marketing chair for <a href="http://issa.infosci.cornell.edu/about.html">Cornell Information Science Student Association</a>, and a Project Coordinator for Cornell Rotaract.</p>
                <p>If you would like to chat, feel free to drop me a line at <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="mailto: mh999@cornell.edu"> mh999@cornell.edu</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
