                <h6>Hi there!</h6>
                <p>I'm Michael, a sophomore studying Information Science at Cornell, with concentrations in User Experience, Interactive Technologies, and Behavioral Science.</p>
                <p>Although I intended to study Economics, I found a passion for product design through some great mentors and professors.</p>
                <p>In school, I am a product designer for Cornell Design & Tech Initiative, the marketing chair for Cornell's Information Science Student Association, and a Project Coordinator for Cornell Rotaract.</p>
