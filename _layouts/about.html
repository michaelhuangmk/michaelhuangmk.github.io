                <h6>Hi there!</h6>
                <p>I'm Michael, a sophomore studying Information Science at Cornell, with concentrations in User Experience, Interactive Technologies, and Behavioral Science.</p>
                <p>Although I intended to study Economics, I discovered a passion for product design, specifically in applying the design process towards solving real-world problems for real people. 
                <p>In school, I am a product designer for <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="http://cornelldti.org/">Cornell Design & Tech Initiative</a>, the marketing chair for <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="http://issa.infosci.cornell.edu/">Cornell Information Science Student Association</a>, and an intern for <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="http://dos.cornell.edu/asian-asian-american-center">Cornell A3C</a>.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to cook, play volleyball, learn languages, and practice the ukelele.</p>
                <p>If you would like to chat, feel free to drop me a line at <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="mailto:mh999@cornell.edu"> mh999@cornell.edu</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
