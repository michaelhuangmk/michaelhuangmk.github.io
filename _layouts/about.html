        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>I'm Michael, a senior studying Information Science at Cornell, with concentrations in User Experience and Interactive Technologies. I'm also pursuing double minors in Cognitive Science and Business.

Previously, I was a product design intern at <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM</a>, and worked as a UX designer &amp; front-end developer in collaboration with <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://www.fairtradecertified.org/">Fair Trade USA</a>.</p>  
        <p>In school, I am a product designer for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://www.cornellappdev.com/">Cornell AppDev</a>, design advisor for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://cornelldti.org/">Cornell Design &amp; Tech Initiative</a>, and the marketing chair for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://issa.infosci.cornell.edu/"> Cornell Information Science Student Association</a>.</p>
