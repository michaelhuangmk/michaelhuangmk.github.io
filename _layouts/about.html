        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>I'm Michael, a Masters student in Information Science at Cornell, graduating in Fall 2020. I recently completed my undergrad there, majoring in Information Science with a minor in business.</p>  
        <p>Most recently, I joined <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://facebook.design/">Facebook</a> AR/VR as a product design intern. Previously, I designed for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://design.google/">Google</a>'s Geo team, <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM</a>'s Patterns design program, and <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://www.fairtradecertified.org/">Fair Trade USA</a> in collaboration with Cornell CIS.</p>  
        <p>In school, I am a product designer for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://www.cornellappdev.com/">Cornell AppDev</a>, instructor for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/intro-to-digital-product-design/lecture-1-what-is-product-design-c290bfe799a9">Intro to Digital Product Design</a>, and the marketing chair for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://issa.infosci.cornell.edu/"> Cornell Information Science Student Association</a>.</p>
        <p>When I'm not designing, I love experimenting with new recipes, exploring new places, and staying abreast of the newest memes.</p>
        <p>If you would like to chat, feel free to drop me a line at <a class="u-darkblue" href="mailto:mh999@cornell.edu"> mh999@cornell.edu</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
