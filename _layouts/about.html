        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>I'm Michael, a junior studying Information Science at Cornell, with concentrations in User Experience and Interactive Technologies. I'm also pursuing double minors in Cognitive Science and Business. 
        <p>Although I intended to study Economics, I fell in love with design and the way it balances my creative and practical perspectives to solve real-world problems for real people.</p>
        <p>This summer, I am interning at <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://design.google/">Google</a> as a UX designer. Previously, I was a product design intern with <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM</a>, and worked in collaboration with <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="https://www.fairtradecertified.org/">Fair Trade USA</a> as a UX designer &amp; front-end developer.</p>  
        <p>In school, I am a product designer for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://www.cornellappdev.com/">Cornell AppDev</a>, the design lead for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://cornelldti.org/">Cornell Design &amp; Tech Initiative</a>, and the marketing chair for <a class="u-darkblue" target="_blank" href="http://issa.infosci.cornell.edu/"> Cornell Information Science Student Association</a>.</p>
        <p>If you would like to chat, feel free to drop me a line at <a class="u-darkblue" href="mailto:mh999@cornell.edu"> mh999@cornell.edu</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
