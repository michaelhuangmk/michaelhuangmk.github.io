                <h6>Hi there!</h6>
                <p>I'm Michael, a sophomore studying Information Science at Cornell, with concentrations in User Experience and Interactive Technologies. I'm also pursuing double minors in Computer Science and Business.</p>
                <p>Although I intended to study Economics, I discovered a passion for product design along the way, specifically in applying the design process to solve real-world problems for real people. 
                <p>In school, I am a product designer for <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="http://cornelldti.org/">Cornell Design & Tech Initiative</a>, the marketing chair for the <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="http://issa.infosci.cornell.edu/"> Information Science Student Association</a>, and an analyst for <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="http://www.sustainablecampus.cornell.edu/initiatives/sustainable-enterprise-association-sea"> Cornell Sustainable Enterprise Association</a>.</p>
                <p>If you would like to chat, feel free to drop me a line at <a class="u-dodgerblue" href="mailto:mh999@cornell.edu"> mh999@cornell.edu</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
